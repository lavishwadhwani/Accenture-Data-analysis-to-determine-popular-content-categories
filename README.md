# Background
Social Buzz is a media company who want:

- Merging and cleaning of sample data set tables
- An analysis of their content categories that highlight the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity

# Task
In this project, I have done data merging, data cleaning and data analysis using Excel and SQL as well as data visualisation with a dashboard in Tableau. All the files are provided including raw datasets, the final dataset and finally a pdf document which contains SQL code and an explanation of the analytical process.
